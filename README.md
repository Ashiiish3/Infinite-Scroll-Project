## Infinite-Scroll-Project

### Introduction
This project demonstrates an efficient infinite scrolling interface using React and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to seamlessly browse through a list of itemsâ€”such as images, without the need for pagination. As users scroll down, new items are automatically fetched and displayed, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Features
1. Infinite Scrolling:
   - Items load dynamically as the user scrolls, creating a smooth and continuous browsing experience.
2. API Integration:
   - Utilizes an external API to fetch data asynchronously, demonstrating real-world application.
